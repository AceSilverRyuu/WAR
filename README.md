How it Works:
Rules of WAR:

<ol>
       <li>Each player gets dealt 26 cards face down.</li>
       <li>The players pull the top card form their decks and flip them face up at the same time.</li> 
       <li>The highest card wins and the winner collects the other players card.</li>
       <li>Place the cards won on bottom of winner's deck</li>
       <li>Repeat rules 2-4 until one player is out of cards.</li>
      <li> Player with the all cards in the end wins.</li>
      IF the cards are of the same value, Declare WAR.</li>
  </ol>
  
      Rules of Declare WAR: 
       1. The players draw the top 3 cards and place them face down.
       2. The players then draw a card from their deck and place it face up.
       3. Highest card wins and the winner collects all 8 cards used in the Declare WAR.
       4. Place the cards won on the bottom of winner's deck
       5. Continue normal WAR rules 2-4 until a player has all cards
